1. Open the website, plug in the controller and press the buttons to make it connect.
2. Plug in the servo module via microusb after connecting the battery, click anywhere on the webpage.
3. Choose the servo module in the serial window, and you should be good.

If it doesn't connect with serial, you might have to try a different usb port or computer. 
If it ever has an error or disconnects, you have to reload the page and do step 2 and 3.
